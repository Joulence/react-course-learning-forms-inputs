# React Course Project: Working with Forms and User Inputs

This is the README file for the React course project that focuses on forms and user inputs. In this project, we will explore various concepts and techniques related to handling forms and user inputs in React applications.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a React application that involves working with forms and user inputs. It will cover the following key features:

- Creating forms with different input fields (text, email, password, etc.).
- Managing form state and validation.
- Handling user input events and form submissions.
- Implementing form validation and displaying error messages.
- Utilizing controlled components to manage form state.
- Implementing form reset and clearing input fields.
- Using form libraries and components (optional, if applicable).

## Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joulence/react-course-learning-forms-inputs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-course-learning-forms-inputs
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
